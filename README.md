#Bank Account Manager Assignment

This was an assignment set to create a bank account manager for bank staff.

The biggest issue is that this uses XML to manage the accounts, the assignment was testing our uses of classes so I opted for XML instead of a database, allowing me to view changes in plaintext
Another glaring issue is the lack of authentication in a bank system, allowing employees to manipulate peoples accounts with abandon.

suffice to say this is not a good banking system, but it fulfilled it's needs as an assignment.
